The license is a bit confusing.

The intent is to make the Python code under the MIT (attribution) license.

The css sheets and JavaScript come from RGruet's guide and are under the
Creative Commons NC/Attribution/Share as seen in the html files.

The html files are therefore under Creative Commons while the generator is MIT.
